 Final Project
 
Estimated time needed: 60 minutes

Objectives
You work for a company who provides career services for those with lower incomes. The marketing team has a small budget and wants your help to find out which demographics (age, education, gender, etc) to target advertise to in the US. You will create an interactive dashboard with Shiny to explore census data to figure out what trends in different demographics you can find and tell the marketing team your findings.

Dataset Used
The dataset you will use is the UCI Adult dataset. The dataset was taken from the Census database and contains demographic information on people. The variables you will focus on are:

native_country: the person's native country
age: age of person
hours_per_week: number of hours the person works per week
education: education level
workclass: class of work like federal government or private etc.
sex: male or female
prediction: the income level, either "<=50K" or ">50K", you will facet your graphs by this variable
